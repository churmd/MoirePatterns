# MoirePatterns

A Moire pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern) visualiser. The visulaiser functions by overlaying two images consisting of a black pattern with transparent gaps. When the top layer is rotated or moved, an optical illusion will take place. 

To use this, import into Eclipse and run the Main file.
The drop down menu and sliders on the screen can be used to alter the pattern being used and manipulate the top layer.
